# Steps to run locally:

1. `cd frontend` to change into the directory.
2. `npm install` to install the dependency.
3. `yarn start` to run start the server

## Improvements that can be made.

1. Get google client_id token from backend server. Never hardcode and push it to repo.
2. More filtering option for the healthcare providers. Pharmacy/Clinic/Hospital.

### Note: I am attaching the preview for the frontend in the email, as i am having problem with google-auth in production environment. I was not able to fix that in given time.
